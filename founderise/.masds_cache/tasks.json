{"reasoning": "To successfully build and deploy the chatbot application described in the PRD, the system needs to include modular microservices (LLM Manager, Agents Manager, Database Manager), an integrated web frontend, and key configuration, middleware, and testing setups. Given the provided directory and existing files, I will decompose the project into atomic tasks that incrementally fulfill the given requirements, ensuring each microservice and the web application have their required functionality and integrations. Each task is designed to be modular and granular, focusing on individual file changes, starting from scaffolding, configuration, implementing specific features, and testing, while addressing
