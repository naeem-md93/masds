{"reasoning": "To implement the health check endpoint for the LLM microservice as specified in the task, the required steps are: 1) Create a new route file `src/microservices/llm/routes/health.js`, which defines the `GET /health` endpoint to return the microservice health status. This file needs to utilize Express Router to define the route and respond with a 200 status code and a JSON payload indicating the health of the service. Since the task depends on `src/microservices/llm/config/index.js` for configuration, no additional setup is needed in this file as the configuration file already exists. This script writes the required code in the newly created `health.js` route file.", "implementation": ["#!/usr/bin/env bash", "set -euo pipefail", "", "# Navigate to the LLM microservice routes directory", "cd src/microservices/llm/routes", "", "# Create health.js and implement the endpoint", "cat << 'EOF' > health.js", "// Import required dependencies", "const express = require('express');", "", "// Create a new router instance", "const router = express.Router();", "", "// Define the health check route", "router.get('/health', (req, res) => {", "    res.status(200).json({ status: 'LLM Microservice is healthy' });", "});", "", "// Export the router", "module.exports = router;", "EOF", "", "echo '\u2705 Task complete: Health check endpoint implemented in src/microservices/llm/routes/health.js.'"]}
