{"reasoning": "The project description provides a solid foundation but lacks some specific technical and functional details. These include authentication/authorization, expected scalability needs, API specifications, error handling approaches, and UI details for the web app. Assumptions have been made to fill these gaps. I assumed the web app should support modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, etc.) and basic session management. For APIs, RESTful design is assumed, as no preference was specified. Server-port defaults and middleware inclusivity (e.g., CORS, rate limiting) are added for completeness. Additionally, I assumed an admin interface for managing LLMs, personas, and databases since management was implied but not detailed.", "prd": {"Overview": "A chatbot application built using Node.js and AzureOpenAI, composed of three microservices (LLM Manager, Agents Manager, Database Manager), communicating via APIs.
