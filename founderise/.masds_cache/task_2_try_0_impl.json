{"reasoning": "The task requires creating a configuration file for the LLM microservice to handle environment variables such as DEFAULT_LLM, API_KEY, and others. This file will centralize and simplify access to these environment variables. Following the Node.js convention and project structure, the file will be created as `src/microservices/llm/config/index.js`. Using the `dotenv` library, we'll load environment variables and export them as a module for use in other parts of the LLM microservice. This ensures the microservice can dynamically adjust to different environments without hardcoding sensitive values.", "implementation": ["#!/usr/bin/env bash", "set -euo pipefail", "", "echo 'Creating the configuration file for the LLM microservice...'", "", "# Ensure the required directory exists", "mkdir -p src/microservices/llm/config", "", "# Write the configuration file `index.js`", "cat << 'EOF' > src/microservices/llm/config/index.js", "// Configuration setup for LLM Microservice", "", "const dotenv = require('dotenv');", "dotenv.config();", "", "module.exports = {", "  port: process.env.LLM_PORT || 3001,", "  apiKey: process.env.LLM_API_KEY || '',", "  apiEndpoint: process.env.LLM_API_ENDPOINT || '',", "  defaultLLM: process.env.DEFAULT_LLM || 'AzureOpenAI',", "};", "", "EOF", "", "echo '\u2705 Configuration file for LLM microservice created successfully.'"]}
