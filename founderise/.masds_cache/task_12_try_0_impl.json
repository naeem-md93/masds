{"reasoning": "The task requires creating a health check endpoint in the 'src/microservices/agents/routes/health.js' file for monitoring the health of the Agents microservice. This is critical for ensuring that the service can provide a status report on its operational state. The endpoint will be implemented as a GET route '/health', which responds with a 200 status code and a JSON object describing the service health. The implementation involves importing the required dependencies, setting up the route, and exporting the router.
